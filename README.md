PDF Scraping App
This is a PDF scraping application that can be used to extract information from all kinds of PDF reports. It uses various libraries and tools to parse and analyze the PDF content. Please note that this app is not limited to a specific type of PDF report, and it can work with different PDF files containing various types of data.

How to Use
Install Dependencies:
Before running the application, make sure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit pandas pillow PyPDF2 streamlit_extras langchain
Running the App:
To run the application, execute the Python script that contains the code for the app. The main file is named app.py.

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
About the App:
The app is powered by LLM (Language Model) and is designed to help extract information from PDF files. It uses various libraries and tools, such as PyPDF2 for PDF parsing, LangChain for text processing and embeddings, and OpenAI's language model (text-davinci-003) for question-answering tasks.

Sidebar Contents:
When you run the app, you will see a sidebar containing information about the app and an image related to PDF parsing.

PDF File Selection:
The app is currently set to process a specific PDF file named tsla-def14a_20220804-gen.pdf. You can modify the pdf_file variable in the code to use a different PDF file.

PDF Text Chunking:
The PDF file is processed by extracting its text and then dividing it into smaller chunks. This step is necessary to ensure efficient processing and avoid limitations imposed by certain language models.

Embeddings and Vector Store:
The app uses OpenAIEmbeddings to create embeddings of the text chunks. These embeddings are stored in a vector store created using FAISS. The vector store helps with similarity searches when answering questions related to the PDF content.

Answering Questions:
The app can answer specific questions related to the PDF content. For example, it can extract information from the "SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE" by providing specific column headers. The app uses the OpenAI language model to generate answers based on the information stored in the vector store.

JSON Output:
The answers generated by the app are returned in JSON format, providing structured information.

Using the App for Other PDFs:
You can use this app to process other PDF files as well. Simply modify the pdf_file variable to point to the desired PDF file. However, make sure the PDF structure and content are compatible with the app's current implementation.

Executives Selection:
After processing the PDF and generating answers, the app allows you to select executive officers from the available data and view their compensation details in a DataFrame.

JSON Storage:
The app also saves the JSON data containing answers to a file named {store_name}.json. This allows you to access the information later without having to reprocess the PDF.

Important Note
Please keep in mind that this app uses the OpenAI language model, which may incur costs depending on usage. Make sure to review and understand the pricing details of the language model and other services used in the app before proceeding with extensive usage.

Remember to replace the pdf_file variable with the path to your desired PDF file if you want to use this app for different PDF reports.

Happy PDF scraping!
